Classification of Heart Disease Using the K-Nearest Neighbor Method


The heart is a human organ that plays a role in the circulatory system. Heart disease is a condition where the heart cannot carry out its duties properly. Globally, the number one cause of death every year is cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is a disease caused by impaired function of the heart and blood vessels.
Data mining is a series of processes of obtaining knowledge or patterns from data sets. Data mining will solve problems by analyzing data that already exists in the database. The output results from data mining can be used to improve decision making. One of the methods used in processing data mining is the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method. KNN is carried out by looking for groups of objects in the training data that are closest or similar to objects in the new data or testing data. Calculating the performance of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method on cardiovascular disease data, the performance calculated is related to accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure.
